## Multibanco with Dynamic References

The Multibanco payment method with Dynamic References generates references per order and is used if you wish to set a time limit (in days) for orders paid with Multibanco.
The Entity and Multibanco Key are automatically loaded upon entering the Backoffice Key.
Configure the payment method. The image below shows an example of a minimally functional configuration.

Follow the steps for configuring Multibanco (as indicated above) with the following change:

1. **Entity** - Select "Dynamic Multibanco References," this entity will only be available for selection if you've entered into a contract for the creation of a Dynamic Multibanco References account.
2. **Multibanco Key** - Select a Multibanco Key. You can only choose one of the Multibanco Keys associated with the Entity chosen earlier.
3. **Deadline** - Select the number of days the Multibanco reference will be valid. Leaving this field empty will mean that the Multibanco reference does not expire.


Examples of deadlines:
- Choosing a deadline of 0 days: If an order is created on 22/03/2023 at 15:30, the generated Multibanco reference will expire on 22/03/2023 at 23:59, which is the end of the day it was generated.
- Choosing a deadline of 1 day: If an order is created on 22/03/2023 at 9:30, the generated Multibanco reference will expire on 23/03/2023 at 23:59, which means the Multibanco reference will be valid for the day it was generated plus 1 day.
- Choosing a deadline of 3 days: If an order is created on 22/03/2023 at 20:30, the generated Multibanco reference will expire on 25/03/2023 at 23:59, which means the Multibanco reference will be valid for the day it was generated plus 3 days.

## Refund

The MB WAY and Credit Card payment methods allow for full or partial refunds of the amount paid by the consumer through the refund tab on the order details page in the store's admin back office.

(The following steps are the same for both the MB WAY and Credit Card payment methods).
![img](https://github.com/josesoaresif/opencartReleaseTest/raw/assets/version4/assets/sales_orders.png)
</br>

In the Order History panel, click on the Refund tab (1).
![img](https://github.com/josesoaresif/opencartReleaseTest/raw/assets/version4/assets/order_history.png)
</br>

1. Fill in the refund amount, which cannot exceed the order amount.
2. (optional) Fill in the refund description. This description is only visible in the store's back office and can be used to record the reason for the refund.
3. Click on Refund Payment to proceed with the refund.

</br>


# Other
  
## Support

On the configuration page of each payment method, you can find a Support button (1) that redirects you to the ifthenpay support page, where you can create a support ticket.
For your convenience, you can also access this user manual by clicking on the Instructions button (2), which will redirect you to the GitHub page where you can find the user manual.
![img](https://github.com/josesoaresif/opencartReleaseTest/raw/assets/version4/assets/support.png)
</br>

 ## Request additional account


If you already have an ifthenpay account but haven't contracted a needed payment method, you can place an automatic request with ifthenpay.
The response time for this request is 1 to 2 business days, with the exception of the Credit Card payment method, which might exceed this time due to validation requirements.
To request the creation of an additional account, access the configuration page of the payment method you wish to contract and click on Request ... Account (1).
![img](https://github.com/josesoaresif/opencartReleaseTest/raw/assets/version4/assets/request_account.png)
</br>

In the case that you already have a Multibanco account with static references and need an account for Multibanco with dynamic references, you can do so on the Multibanco configuration page by clicking on the Request Dynamic Multibanco Account button (1) at the bottom of the page.
![img](https://github.com/josesoaresif/opencartReleaseTest/raw/assets/version4/assets/request_account_multibanco_dynamic.png)
</br>

When you click on Request New Account, a dialog box will appear where you can confirm the action by clicking OK (1).
![img](https://github.com/josesoaresif/opencartReleaseTest/raw/assets/version4/assets/confirm_request_account.png)
</br>

As a result, the ifthenpay team will add the payment method to your account, updating the list of available payment methods in your extension.

IMPORTANT: When requesting an account for the Credit Card payment method, the ifthenpay team will contact you to request more information about your online store and your business before activating the payment method.

</br>


## Reset Configuration

This functionality allows you to reset the configuration of the payment method and is useful in the following scenarios:
- If you have acquired a new Backoffice Key and want to assign it to your website, but you already have one currently assigned.
- If you have requested the creation of an additional account by phone or ticket and want to update the list of payment methods to use the new account.
- If you want to reset the configuration of the payment method to reconfigure it.

In the configuration of the selected payment method, click on the Reset Configuration button (1) and confirm the action by clicking OK.

**Attention, this action will clear the current payment method configuration**;

![img](https://github.com/josesoaresif/opencartReleaseTest/raw/assets/version4/assets/clear_configuration.png)
</br>

After clearing the configuration, you will be prompted to enter the Backoffice Key again.
![img](https://github.com/josesoaresif/opencartReleaseTest/raw/assets/version4/assets/cleared_configuration.png)

</br>


## Callback

IMPORTANT: Only the Multibanco, MB WAY, and Payshop payment methods allow activating the Callback. The Credit Card method changes the order status automatically without using the Callback.

The Callback is a feature that, when enabled, allows your store to receive notifications of successful payments. Upon receiving a successful payment for an order, the ifthenpay server communicates with your store, changing the order status to "Processing." You can use ifthenpay payments without activating the Callback, but your orders won't automatically update their status.

As mentioned in the configurations above, to activate the Callback, access the extension's configuration page and enable the "Enable Callback" option. After saving the settings, the process of associating your store and payment method with ifthenpay's servers will run, and a new "Callback" group (for information only) will appear, showing the Callback status (1), the anti-phishing key (2), and the Callback URL (3).

After activating the Callback, you don't need to take any further action. The Callback is active and functioning.

![img](https://github.com/josesoaresif/opencartReleaseTest/raw/assets/version4/assets/callback.png)

</br>


## Test Callback

On each payment method configuration page (except for Credit Card), you can test the Callback functionality by clicking the "Test Callback" button. This action will simulate a successful payment for an order in your store, changing its status. You need to have the Callback active to access this functionality.

</br>

**Multibanco**: In the backoffice, use the following data (1) and (2) from the order payment details
![img](https://github.com/josesoaresif/opencartReleaseTest/raw/assets/version4/assets/test_callback_data_multibanco.png)
</br>


and enter them in the respective fields (1) and (2) of the Callback test form, then click on Test (3).
Note: The Multibanco reference should be entered without spaces, and the value, if it has decimals, should be separated by a dot.
![img](https://github.com/josesoaresif/opencartReleaseTest/raw/assets/version4/assets/test_callback_form_multibanco.png)

</br>


**MB WAY**: In the backoffice, use the following data (1) and (2) from the order payment details
![img](https://github.com/josesoaresif/opencartReleaseTest/raw/assets/version4/assets/test_callback_data_payshop.png)
</br>


and enter them in the respective fields (1) and (2) of the Callback test form, then click on Test (3).
Note: The value, if it has decimals, should be separated by a dot.
![img](https://github.com/josesoaresif/opencartReleaseTest/raw/assets/version4/assets/test_callback_form_payshop.png)

</br>


**Payshop**: In the backoffice, use the following data (1) and (2) from the order payment details
![img](https://github.com/josesoaresif/opencartReleaseTest/raw/assets/version4/assets/test_callback_data_payshop.png)
</br>


and enter them in the respective fields (1) and (2) of the Callback test form, then click on Test (3).
Note: The value, if it has decimals, should be separated by a dot.
![img](https://github.com/josesoaresif/opencartReleaseTest/raw/assets/version4/assets/test_callback_form_payshop.png)

</br>


## Cronjob

A cron job is a scheduled task that is automatically executed at specific intervals in the system. The ifthenpay extension provides a cron job to check the payment status and cancel orders that haven't been paid within the configured time limit. The table below shows the time limit for each payment method, which the cron job checks and cancels orders that haven't been paid within the time limit. This time limit can be configured only for the Multibanco with Dynamic References and Payshop payment methods.

| Payment Method     | Payment Deadline              |
|--------------------|-----------------------------|
| Multibanco         | No deadline                   |
| Dynamic Multibanco | Configurable from 1 to n days |
| MB WAY             | 30 minutes                  |
| Payshop            | Configurable from 1 to 99 days |
| Credit Card        | 30 minutes                  |

To activate the cron job, access the extension's configuration page and enable the "Enable Cancel Cron Job" option, then click on Save.
The configuration page will update and display the Cron job URL (1), which should be added to your server to execute the cron job.
![img](https://github.com/josesoaresif/opencartReleaseTest/raw/assets/version4/assets/cronjob_url.png)

</br>


## Logs

For easier error detection, the ifthenpay extension logs the errors that occur during its execution. The logs are stored in a text file at storage/logs/ifthenpay.log. To access the logs, go to the root of the storage/ folder, navigate to the logs/ folder, and open the ifthenpay.log file.

Note: The location of the storage folder is defined after the installation of Opencart and may vary for each installation.

</br>


# Customer usage experience

The following describes the consumer user experience when using ifthenpay payment methods on a "stock" installation of Opencart 4. Please note that this experience might change with the addition of one-page checkout extensions.

On the checkout page, after selecting the shipping method, the consumer can choose the payment method.
